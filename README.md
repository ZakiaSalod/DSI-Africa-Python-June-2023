## Teaching Approach for Sessions
Although two main kinds of sessions are envisaged – foundations (theory) and applications (practical), there will be flexibility to blend the two approaches to suit the current need.
Foundations
1.	Introduce and demonstrate concepts (30 min)
2.	Facilitate one group break away activity per session and allow groups to give feedback. (15 min)
3.	Introduce practical examples (30 min)
4.	Facilitate question and answer activity (15 min)
To promote engagement Google Forms will be used for short quizzes and feedback activities at different parts of the session. 

## Applications
1.	Introduce activity and expectations (30 min)
2.	Group work (60 min)
3.	Group presentations (90 min)
Note that the application sessions will be conducted in pairs, with the latter session reserved for presentations – (delegates assumed to have personal laptops). Delegates will be introduced to programming best practice and 4 roles will be emphasised – analyst, developer, tester and presenter. Group members will be required to get exposure to different roles through the different activities.
